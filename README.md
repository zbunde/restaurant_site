This repository contains the basic skeleton for a static web site that can be deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). See [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby) for the full details.

This site requires the [Bundler gem](http://bundler.io/) to be installed (`gem install bundler`).

To run a local version of the server, run `bundle install`  and `rackup` at a command line prompt. You can then navigate a browser to [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292) to see the running site.
